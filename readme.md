# Notes App

This is a basic Notes app built on Meteor I learned taking Andrew Mead's Udemy course.

## Getting Started

This app required you to have Meteor installed on your machine.  Then you can clone the repo and run the following:

```
meteor npm install
```

```
Meteor
```

## Running the Tests

Running the tests is simple. Just run the following command and view the reporter at localhost:3000.

```
npm test
```
